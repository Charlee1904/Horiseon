##Horiseon

##Refactoring code for more accessibility

Took code and updated some of the tags for more accessibility.

##Usage

Examples of changes made to HTML

Here we take a tag that is usually a div and replaced it with Nav to show
the following section is used for navagation.

Examples of changes made to CSS

Trimmed down some of the code by combining similar styles
with a class tag.

Before

After

Also restructured the CSS so it flows with
the HTML code.So the content section was moved ahead of the benefits.
