##Refactoring code for more accessibility

Took code and updated some of the tags for more accessibility.

##Usage

Examples of changes made to HTML

Here the div tag was changed to nav to highlight the selected
items are used for navigation.


Here is the new look of the div


Examples of changes made to CSS

Trimmed down some of the code by combining similar styles
with a class tag.



Also restructured the CSS so it flows with
the HTML code.So the content section was moved ahead of the benefits.
